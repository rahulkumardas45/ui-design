Description
This project is a clean, modern landing page designed to be fully responsive across all devices, from large desktops down to small mobile phones. It features a hero section, a "Why Compliance Matters" section with features, and a fully functional slide-in mobile navigation menu.

Features
Fully Responsive: The layout adapts from desktop to tablet to mobile using CSS Media Queries.

Mobile Navigation: A clean, slide-in navigation menu (toggled with JavaScript) with a dark overlay.

Modern CSS: Built with Flexbox for layout, CSS Variables for easy theme management (colors, fonts), and subtle hover animations.

Semantic HTML: Uses semantic HTML5 elements (<header>, <main>, <section>, <nav>) for better accessibility and SEO.

Pure JavaScript: No libraries or frameworks. Just a simple, clean DOM manipulation script to toggle the mobile menu.

Icon Fonts: Uses Font Awesome for the hamburger and close (X) icons.
